      <h3 style="text-align:center;" >RQlik Code-of-Conduct </h3>
  <p>
  
  
  <p>This Student Code of Conduct (C-o-C) sets out the standards of conduct required from all students of rQlik as well as provides student a general notice of prohibited conduct. Besides providing a clear framework, the policies and procedures are designed to mirror expectations from our students so that they can hold themselves in a professional environment. The Code along with the T&C is a binding on students. </P>
  
  <p>rQlik reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, add, replace or delete all or any part of the Code at any time without notifying the students in advance. The Code of Conduct, along with any other document as published by rQlik shall be applicable and binding in relation to the behaviour of the students either in-person, written, or conducted online.  
    All students are expected to know and abide by the Code of Conduct and all published policies and procedures. rQlik shall have the absolute right to expel students from the program who do not abide by the terms of this Code of Conduct or who are in breach of their responsibilities as set out in this Code of Conduct.
    </P> 
  
  
  <p>RQlik value an educational environment that respects the values of individual students and their personal and professional development. We strive to create and maintain an environment in which individuals are treated with dignity, decency, respect and provide students the best learning experience.<p>
  
    <p>rQlik prohibits unlawful discrimination and harassment of staff, instructors, and students. We hold our student community to high standards and expect staff, instructors, and students to engage with each other in a professional manner.</p>
  <p>Any unprofessional/unethical incident that happens outside rQlik network will be considered an alleged violation of the rQlik’s policies in the following cases;</p>
  <ol>
  <li>When the incident adversely impacted the mission and/or values of rQlik. </li>
  <li>When the incident was recognized by others as being carried out by a rQlik student.  </li>
  <li>When the incident adversely impacted the mental, emotional, or physical health, safety, and/or security of rQlik community members (including the students, instructors and the staff of rQlik)  </li>
  
  </ol>


  
  <p>Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in a warning, suspension or withdrawal from the program (whole or part thereof) as per the severity level. If a student is removed due to code of conduct violations, they cannot be readmitted to the program.</p>   
  
  
  
  <p>rQlik expects each Student to actively participate in their course by attending all lectures, lab hours, having an online presence during the course, engaging with their instructor and collaborating with other Students.
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
    Students must follow a five-day working schedule from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm (Mon-Fri) and must make themselves available on a need basis on Saturdays for any Expert sessions or mentor hours when requested. 
    Students must have a minimum attendance of 90% (every week) during the course. 
    If a student proposes to take a leave, the student should inform the management a day in advance, by addressing an email to <a href="#" style="color: #1bb1dc;">admin@rqlik.org </a>
    Leave of 2 (two) days or more may only be taken with the prior permission of the management by addressing & getting confirmation via email to <a href="#" style="color: #1bb1dc;">admin@rqlik.org</a>
    
  </p>
  
  
  <p>In case of missing a significant number of classes and as a result being unable to catch up with the curriculum, the student may be asked to attend the next upcoming batch by clearing the admission process again. The student agrees that such admission for the next batch shall be at the sole discretion of rQlik. 
  </p>
  
  
  <p>rQlik expects students to complete assignments within the due date specified because the concepts learned in one assignment are a building block needed for future assignments.  Even if a student knows a concept, repetition solidifies the foundation of their knowledge. We encourage Students to reach for stretch goals and practice on their own. Students must have at least 90% assignment submission rates (within due dates), if the completion rates are below 90% disciplinary action will be taken i.e., granting of warning to the student, the expulsion of the student from the program as mentioned in rQlik T&C.
  </p>
   <p>rQlik is fortunate to have Students, instructors, and staff from extremely diverse backgrounds. Students are expected to do their part to make rQlik a welcoming place to learn by encouraging their fellow Students, offering support, and listening to others.</p>
  
  <p>rQlik is a professional environment. It is expected that Students act accordingly. Punctuality, timeliness, accountability, and open communication are crucial not only for a student's success at rQlik but also in their careers afterwards. The professional expectations that rQlik requires of its students are the same a student's future employers will expect of them. Professionalism should be a theme that runs through a student's work and interactions at rQlik. Additionally, professionalism includes protecting the intellectual property of rQlik, that means students respect copyright and ownership of others' materials and those of rQlik itself. Students are encouraged to have a positive mindset in this learning program and utilize the tools and resources effectively to reach personal and professional heights. </p>
<p>We value your feedback: <a href="#" style="color: #1bb1dc;">feedback@rqlik.org</a> </p>

<p>All the Best! </p>
